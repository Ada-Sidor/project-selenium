# Car Reservation Tests

The goal of this project is to verify that the car reservation process performs as expected and that its various features, such as date selection, pick-up location, car class, insurance options, payment methods, and contact information, are all functioning correctly.

## Tests Executed in Project

- Test Case 1: Reservation without account - reservation period is too long
- Test Case 2: Reservation without account - required pick-up field is empty
- Test Case 3: Reservation without account - reservation period is too short
- Test Case 4: Reservation without account - no selected insurance option
- Test Case 5: Reservation without account - no selected payment method option
- Test Case 6: Reservation without account - choosing a later date and then an earlier date on the calendar results in the second click becoming the pick-up date of the car, and the first one becoming the return date
- Test Case 7: Reservation without account - valid data.
